# lit-modal-portal

The `lit-modal-portal` package provides a specialized portal mechanism for modals, developed with the [Lit](https://lit.dev) framework.
It is inspired by [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) and also developed with
a focus on utilizing the Lit API wherever possible, with the intent to both provide flexibility and abide by the
[principle of least surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment).

Specifically, the package exports a `<modal-portal>` Lit component that should be added to the bottom of your app root
and implements a modal stack that can be consumed from _anywhere_ with an exported `pushModal()` function
(even from within a modal).
The package also provides a `portal()` directive that encapsulates the behavior of evaluating the template
for a modal and pushing/popping it from the modal stack based on a given boolean expression.

### Note on UI/UX Best Practices for Modals, Dialogs, Overlays, etc.

A fair number of guides on how to design and develop modals can be found online,
and we encourage you to consult resources such as these when using this package.
Many common suggestions fall into one of the two following categories:

1. What types of content should appear in a modal, or what a modal's visual appearance should be.
2. When and how a modal should (dis)appear.

The responsibilities of the first category, as well as most of the second category, are left to you
as the consumer of this package.
We _do_ provide some accessibility features and common desired behaviors (see below).
Ironically, the ability to "nest" modals inside (or rather, _in front of_) each other is considered bad practice.
While we do not expect you to purposefully creating a large modal stack in production, the code in this package
was designed with a specific use case in mind, in which a modal contains buttons whose actions require confirmation.

Without further ado, let's dive in.
